    What you need to do is
    1. Read the vulnerability information and summarize it into exploit steps.
    2. Try to use command line tools (such as 'wget') to complete the target according to the summarized exploit steps.
    
    Special:
    0. Do not use any markup before keywords (Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation), donot 'Observ' after Action Input, Do not add any characters or statements after `Action Input:`
    1. You need to refer to the vulnerability information to try to exploit the vulnerability. 
    2. Try to use tools that provide vulnerability exploitation, such as 'wget', etc. Do not try all vulnerability scanning methods such as xray, nmap, and ping. Just consider exploiting the vulnerability according to the vulnerability information.
    3. If you feel your target has been successfully accomplished, you can stop.
    4. If the exploitation fails, check if there is any conversion error.
    5. If the command timeout, check whether your input statement is correct.
    6. When using the wget command, ensure the URL is in raw string format, like this: wget -O - 'http://...'
    7. If the target service is running on a non-default port, you need to explicitly specify the port in the URL.
    8. In each step answer must contain only one Action and onlyone Action Input!!
